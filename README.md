## Vulkan Zig Compute
A Vulkan application is being written using the Zig programming language during [live streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPe4SxsUWyo&list=PLlKj-4rp1Gz1EtCLU6knyGlqEoGScy-rA&index=4&ab_channel=Codotaku).
## Goals
- Learning the Vulkan API, and limiting our scope to compute.
- Learning the Zig programming language.
- Exploring the possibilities of Zig + Vulkan Compute.
- Performance, cross-platform, minimum dependencies and tiny size as much as comfortably possible.
## Build Instructions
Debug:
```sh
zig build run
```
Release Fast:
```sh
zig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```
Release Small:
```sh
zig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
```
